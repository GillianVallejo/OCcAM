OCcAM can be used to generate predictions on a range of spatial scales including broad-scale indicative cumulative impact estimates based on publicly available seabird density data and generic parameters, to fine-scale project-only predictions which can be used to understand risk associated with project design parameters and as a starting point for early stakeholder consultation.
